Line Follower Robot: Track Design 
---------------------------------

To desing our own track in Webots we will start by creating a new world. In Webots go to ``File > New > New World File``,
name the file as `my_first_line_follower` and check the `Add rectangle arena` box. You should see something like this:

.. image:: /_static/images/tutorials/empty_world.png

Let's make the arena bigger and change it's appareance. In the Scene Tree on the left, select ``Rectangle Arena`` and then click on 
``floorSize`` and set both parameters to 2 meters. Then right click on ``floorAppareance`` and select ``Delete``. Finally, your
arena should look like this:

Now let's design a circular track for our robot. To do this we will use TinkerCAD, an online 3D modelling program. To use this tool yo have to create
an `Autodesk` account.

.. note:: If you are familiar with other 3D modelling program you can use it. Webots only requires importing the model in one of
          the three following formats: .dae, .stl or .obj.

In TinkerCAD dashboard go to ``Designs > Create > 3D Desing``. First, select the tube shape and drag it to the center of the
Workplane. You should have something like this:

.. image:: /_static/images/tutorials/tube.png

Change the color to black pressing ``Solid``, set the sides to the maximum (64), set the radius to 50 and finally set the height
to 0.01. The final result should be the following:

Click on the ``Export`` option and download the file in `.obj` file format. Rename the `.obj` file as `circular_track` and save it 
in the ``protos`` folder of your project.

Now let's add this new 3D model to Webots. First add a ``Transform`` node clicking on ``+ > Base Nodes > Transform > Add`` and also
add a ``Shape`` node as it's children clicking on ``children > Base Nodes > Shape > Add``. Inside the ``Shape`` node, click
on ``geometry > Base Nodes > Mesh > Add``, and select the path to your .obj file in ``url`` attribute. Finally set the ``Appareance``
attribute as ``appareance > Base Nodes > PBRAppeareance > Add``. Your Scene Tree should be like this:

.. image:: /_static/images/tutorials/scene_tree.png

As you may notice there is no track in our arena. That is because we have not rescaled our 3D object. To do this go to the ``Transform`` 
node and click on the ``Scale`` attribute and set x, y and z attributes to 0,015. Thats All!

.. note:: You have learned how to design a specific track and to insert it in Webots. Remember that you can design your own track
          with a custom shape following the same steps!
